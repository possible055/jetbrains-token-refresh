# Modern Python packaging uses pyproject.toml for all configuration.
# This minimal setup.py exists only for backward compatibility with tools
# that still expect a setup.py file to be present.
#
# All project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration are now
# defined in pyproject.toml according to PEP 621 and PEP 517 standards.
